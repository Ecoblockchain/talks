# Shepherding Random Numbers

My website: 

http://inconvergent.net

I post a lot of work on twitter:

Generative twitter bot:

The first demo used used during the talk is included in `walkers`

The rest of my code is on Github:

https://github.com/inconvergent/

_Warning_: The repositories on Github are all more or less works in progress.
They represent my ideas and experimentation. That means there may be breaking
changes with no warning. It also means that I am unlikely to accept pull
requests. Since all the following repositories are MIT licensed you are quite
free to experiment with it as you wish.

## Things i mentioned during the talk

### Terminology and things

- algorithmic
- computational
- generative
- parametric design
- procedural generation (PCG)
- algorithmic design
- generative systems
- emergent systems
- diffusion-limited aggregation
- boids (separation/avoidance, cohesion, alignment)
- Lindenmayer-systems (Sierpinski triangle)
- game of life (agent based system)
- reaction diffusion (pattern generation, eg. tropical fish)
- craquelure


### Artists

### Challenge

Consider the "10 000  bowls of oatmeal problem" introduced here:

With this in mind: design a system that will continually produce surprising
results
